the problem was solved. The reason is I didn't give correct assignment id. In this version, I can either get information what I want from Canvas, or grade people's assignment. I think I can get only one single assignment from Canvas. Will do it in the next version!

I tried to get assignments from Dov. However, the response was 404 Not Found, which does not match the response I got from PosterMan the day before yesterday. Maybe they change server after 9pm every day for some reasons. I will try tomorrow.
