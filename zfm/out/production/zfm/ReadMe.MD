This version is a demo for demonstration. It can get courses and students information for current user who put token in application. At beginning, I thought users should be put into API. However, seems like you cant get information for all users in one course. You can get specific group of users information by adding certain key words into endpoints. For this demo,I just get students information. One more thing, you can only see student id in server and student name if you dont have high level role on your own.

I have no idea about how to design the GUI.

the problem was solved. The reason is I didn't give correct assignment id. In this version, I can either get information what I want from Canvas, or grade people's assignment. I think I can get only one single assignment from Canvas. Will do it in the next version!

I tried to get assignments from Dov. However, the response was 404 Not Found, which does not match the response I got from PosterMan the day before yesterday. Maybe they change server after 9pm every day for some reasons. I will try tomorrow.
